-------------------</br>
Pros:</br>
Low power consumption.</br>
Good image quality,</br>
Good Blacks.</br>
Nice to look at low ambient light</br>
Decent Speakers with Waves MaxxAudio.</br>
Nice White & Black contrast.</br>
lightweight</br>

Cons:</br>
a bit small,</br>
does Not have hydrophobic coating like phones,</br>
Daylight reflections makes screen look plastic.</br>
looking a glass feels natural,</br>
but looking at a dark plastic feels strange,.</br>
Not as good headphone output as MacMini 2014 for example.</br>
----------------</br>
Daylight / Bulb Reflections must be avoided...</br>
placing a Black curtain or black carpet / black fabric behind you.</br>
and posibly on the sides, like Barn doors.</br>
to avoid black plastic feeling.</br>
----------------</br>
Pixel size comparison:</br>
a 1920x1080-FullHD.jpg = 20" Diagonal monitor.</br>

looks like a 20" monitor + + 2x 7.5" diagonal side screens.</br>
20" Diagonal = 17.25" x 9.5" aprox. 

my experience:</br>
40" UHD Flat NoGo</br>
32" FullHD NoGo "too pixelated"</br>
27" FullHD is the maximum size flat.</br>
55" Flat at 3 meters, NoGo </br>
55" Curved TV at 2 meters, too much power consumption, NoGo </br>

34" WQHD looks portable,</br>
but a bit bigger would be better.</br>

some movies are designed for 21:9, </br>
Those movies Fit like a Glove.</br>
most internet feels square after experiencing a 21:9 Wide Screen.</br>

This type of monitor WQHD "21:9" is nice for DAWs, Mixer, Track view.</br>

LG stand does Not rotate 90°</br>
only goes up & down a few inches.</br>
requires optional Vesa 100x100 mount for more advanced set-ups.</br>

WavesMAXX Audio Enhancement is dissabled when using Headphone output.</br>
Headphone out has weak volume,</br>
speakers at 30 = headphone at 60.</br>
Unplugg headphones while making sound will be very loud.</br>

Mouse speed in OS needs to be increased when upgrading FullHD 1920x1080 to 3440x1440.</br>

LG 34" is similar to ASRock 34" WQHD</br>
Asrock has 2 models: </br>
OLED and standard VA.</br>
this LG is VA.</br>
some claim its inferior vs. LG 34GP950G nano-IPS.</br>

Quick Settings with joystick are OK. </br>
Volume Left & Right</br>
Brightness Forward & Backward</br>
Push-Up = Menu.</br>
Push-Up + Forward = Turn Off.</br>
Push-Up + Hold = Off.</br>
Push-Up + Push-Up = Exit Octagonal OSD Menu.</br>
Left + Left = Exit Square OSC Menu, but... </br>
if standing on a setting, Left does Not work, needs Push-Up to Exit setting.</br>

Black Sabilizer & Black Level (*)Low/High</br>
are similar, Low/High are Coarse Big Jump.</br>
Brightness is also a complementary setting, should be adjusted at same time to Stabilizer.</br>
But Black level is opposite, if (*)High, Brigtness & Black Stabilizer must go down, to have a lower BackLight bleeding.</br>

Black Level (*)Low/High</br>
seems to be a Global setting, </br>
affects other presets.</br>

At 3840x2160 (16:9) = Looks Weird.</br>
At 3440x1440 (43:18) almost (21:9) Default.</br>
OS Scale-Up 125%</br>
is best setting.</br>

At 2560x1080 (21:9) </br>
100% Scaling, looks similar but pixelated, less pixelated vs. 32" FullHD monitor,</br>
at 125% scaling Looks BIG.</br>
32" FHD is NoGo, maximum recomended size 27" FHD.</br>

3440x1440 allows to scale-up nice,</br>
but some software does Not work properly scaled-up, </br>
for example: Air plugins for Protools HD12.7 in Windows8.1</br>
dont like Scaling-Up, requires 100% scale.</br>

Using HDMI 4th gen intel iGPU only allows 50fps at 3440x1440</br>

Next step in monitor is the Samsung G9 49" dual HDMI, or single DP.</br>

some OS, some Video cards has issues with HDMI at higher resolutions, and high frame rates,</br>
sollution is using DisplayPort, or to buy a converter DP-to->8K HDMI-out->.</br>
Monitor comes with DP cable & HDMI cable,</br>
compared vs. Belkin 4K HDMI Premium cable, No difference WQHD at  50fps</br>
Recommended to buy a 90° HDMI adapter. </br>

settings:</br>

Gamer1 & Gamer2 allows more manual configuration settings.</br>
All other presets are very basic/limited.</br>

Gamer1: </br>
Game Ajust:</br>
+Black Sabilizer 50-55</br>
+Response Time: (*)Faster or (*)Fast for Games,</br>
Normal or (*) OFF for Desktop Only.</br>
+Crosshair (*)Off</br>

Picture Adjust:</br>
+Brightness 45</br>
+Contrast 65</br>

+Sharpness 60-70 at 3440x1440</br>
+Sharpness 70 at 2560x1080 "If had 65"</br>

+Gamma Mode 1 for more Vivid, Neutral/Pure White.</br>
+Gamma Mode 2 for more Warm White.</br>
+Gamma Mode 3 for deeper Blacks, works better with more Black Sabilizer vs. other Gamma settings.</br>
+Gamma Mode 4 a bit less than Mode 2, and more Vivid than mode 3, more Yellow white.</br>

Gamma 3 is too dark for this settings.</br>
Gamma 1 looks a bit too bright for this settings, Ok at daylight, </br>
at Night Gamma 2 or 4 would be easy on the eyes with this settings</br>
or Gamma1 with lower Brightness Quick Menu Up & Down.</br>

Volume 33</br>
***************</br>

moving up & down with mouse wheel</br>
on this video, </br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bp640WIoNc</br>
is the most extreme case of Ghosting Bright/white objects with bright/white background.</br>
BUT... only happens with some Gamma settings, Not all.</br>

The oposite, White Objects with total Dark/Black background has 0% GHosting, same setting</br>
